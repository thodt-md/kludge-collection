This is my personal collection of hacks, fixes and workarounds for various problems I had no time and/or knowledge to fix properly. You should really try finding a proper solution before using anything here. :wink:

Pull requests with, for the lack of a better word, _fixes_ are welcome. Suggestions for proper solutions are also welcome, if the solution is more elegant and concise than the kludge.
